One page responsive website


A simple responsive website build using Bootstrap.js and styled using LESS.js preprocessor. An owl carousel slider implementation with a basic form validation provided in bootstrap. This website was built using a free template on PSDChat. I took this project to brush up my skills and to learn Less.js simultaneously. The most challenging part about this website was making a responsive pentagon shapes only using CSS.
